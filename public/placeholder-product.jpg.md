# Placeholder Image Redirect

This file serves as a placeholder for product images. In a production environment, 
you would place an actual placeholder image file here.

For now, you can:
1. Add a placeholder-product.jpg file to the public folder
2. Or modify the image source to use a online placeholder service
3. Or use a data URL for a simple placeholder
